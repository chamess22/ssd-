# SSD_SORT
This is a simple multi-person tracking system.<br>
* Detector:  [SSD](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd).<br>
* Association:  [Sort](https://github.com/abewley/sort).<br>

### Instruction

To run this codeï¼Œyou should install [SSD](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd) and build the python interface. A pretrained person detector caffemodel is also needed for the detector. Our pretrained [caffemodel](https://jbox.sjtu.edu.cn/l/cuaFUs) is also supplied. The image sequence should be stored under sequence folder. Some deploy files are under model folder. Run detrk.py to see the detection and association results. You can also edit some arguments to meet different situations.
